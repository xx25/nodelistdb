# Modem Test Configuration
# Example configuration for the modem-test CLI tool

modem:
  device: "/dev/ttyACM0"
  baud_rate: 115200
  dial_prefix: "ATDT"
  hangup_method: "dtr"  # "dtr" (drop DTR) or "escape" (+++ ATH)

  # Timeouts
  dial_timeout: 200s
  carrier_timeout: 5s
  at_command_timeout: 5s
  read_timeout: 1s

  # Init commands - executed in order during modem initialization
  # Customize these for your specific modem
  init_commands:
    - "ATZ"        # Reset modem to profile 0
    - "ATE0"       # Disable local echo
    - "ATV1"       # Verbose result codes (OK, ERROR, CONNECT, etc.)
    - "ATX4"       # Extended result codes (BUSY, NO DIALTONE, etc.)
    - "ATS0=0"     # Disable auto-answer

  # Post-disconnect commands - executed after hangup to get line statistics
  # These vary by modem manufacturer:
  #   USRobotics: AT&V1
  #   ZyXEL:      ATI11
  #   Generic:    AT+MS?
  post_disconnect_commands:
    - "AT&V1"      # Line quality stats (USRobotics modems)
    # - "ATI11"    # Alternative for ZyXEL modems

  # Delay before post-disconnect commands (modem needs time to compute stats)
  # USRobotics and most modems need 1-2 seconds after hangup
  # Based on bforce (2-3s) and qico (2.5s) implementations
  post_disconnect_delay: 2s

  # Stats profile for parsing line statistics output
  # Profiles: "rockwell" (USR/Conexant), "zyxel", "raw" (no parsing)
  stats_profile: rockwell

test:
  count: 10
  inter_delay: 5s
  # phone: "917"           # Single phone number (can be set via CLI -phone flag)
  # phones:                # Multiple phones - called in circular order
  #   - "917"
  #   - "918"
  #   - "919"
  # csv_file: "modem-test-results.csv"  # Optional: output results to CSV file

  # protocols: ["ZMO", "ZAP"]  # Example: ZModem protocols for actual file transfer

logging:
  debug: true
